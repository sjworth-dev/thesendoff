subtitle: How to organize 10-20 guys without it falling apart
category: Planning

Getting a group of guys to commit, pay up, and show up on time is harder than it sounds. Here's how to actually pull it off.

---

## Step 1: Lock It Down Early

### Set Up Communication

Before anything else, create your command center:

**Group Chat Options:**
- **iMessage** — Simple, works if everyone has iPhones
- **WhatsApp** — Best for mixed phone types
- **Slack/Discord** — For the organized crew

**Money Tracking (Critical):**
- **Splitwise** — Tracks who owes what automatically. Use this.
- **Venmo/Zelle** — For moving money
- **Google Sheet** — For the guy who wants to see everything

**The Golden Rule:** One person runs point. Too many organizers = chaos.

### Timeline

**4-6 Months Out:**
- [ ] Lock the date (propose 2-3 options, then decide)
- [ ] Get firm commitments with deposits ($150-200)
- [ ] Book the house immediately — good ones go fast

**2 Months Out:**
- [ ] Collect flight info from everyone
- [ ] Research activities
- [ ] Book anything that needs reservations

**2 Weeks Out:**
- [ ] Final headcount
- [ ] Collect remaining balance
- [ ] Make dinner/activity reservations

**Day Before:**
- [ ] One guy arrives early to stock the house
- [ ] Share address and check-in info
- [ ] Confirm all reservations

## Step 2: Handle Money Without Drama

Money is where bachelor parties go wrong. Prevent it.

### Collect Upfront

| Item | When | Amount |
|------|------|--------|
| Deposit | At commitment | $150-200 |
| Housing balance | 1 month before | Remainder |
| Activity fund | 2 weeks before | $100-150 |

**Non-negotiable:** No deposit = no spot. People who "will pay later" often don't.

### The Groom's Costs

Traditional: The groom doesn't pay for:
- Housing
- Group dinners
- Activities
- First round at every stop

Divide his share among everyone else. Usually adds $30-50 per person.

### Sample Budget (12 guys, 3 nights)

| Expense | Total | Per Person (11 paying) |
|---------|-------|----------------------|
| House | $3,500 | $318 |
| Groceries/beer | $600 | $55 |
| Group dinner | $1,000 | $91 |
| Charter fishing/activity | $1,500 | $136 |
| Supplies | $200 | $18 |
| **Group Total** | **$6,800** | **$618** |

Add $200-400 for personal expenses (flights, Ubers, extra drinks).

## Step 3: Assign Roles

You're not doing this alone.

**The Organizer (You)**
- Books housing
- Collects money
- Makes final decisions
- Shares itinerary

**The Advance Team**
- Arrives early
- Stocks the fridge with beer
- Has the address and check-in info

**The Activity Lead**
- Books the fishing trip/golf/swamp tour
- Handles reservations
- Keeps track of timing

**The Navigator**
- Orders Ubers for the crew
- Knows where you're going
- Tracks down stragglers

**The Documenter**
- Takes photos (at least some)
- Creates shared album
- Keeps it appropriate for group chat

---

## Step 4: Transportation

### Getting There

**Louis Armstrong Airport (MSY):** 30-40 min from the French Quarter

**From Airport:**
- Uber XL: 6 people, $35-45
- Uber Black SUV: 6 people, $60-70
- Two regular Ubers: 8 people, $50-70 total

Coordinate arrivals. If 3+ guys land within an hour, share a ride.

### Getting Around

**Walking** — French Quarter, Warehouse District, Frenchmen are walkable

**Uber/Lyft** — Main way to get around
- One guy orders all Ubers
- Settles up on Splitwise later
- Uber XL fits 6

**For the Crew (12+):**
- Order multiple Ubers to same destination
- Or book a party bus for big nights ($150-300/hour)

Local services:
- NOLA Party Bus
- Big Easy Limos
- Hummer Limos NOLA

### Do You Need a Car?

No. Don't rent a car. You'll be drinking, parking is expensive, and Ubers are cheap.

## Step 5: The Itinerary Doc

Create a Google Doc with everything. Share it before the trip.

### What to Include

```

## Step 6: House Rules

Set expectations early. Post in the group chat before the trip.

### The Basics

- **Clean up after yourself** — No one wants to do your dishes
- **Pool hours** — Music off by 10pm for neighbors
- **Respect the house** — Damage comes out of everyone's pocket
- **Keys/codes** — Make sure everyone has access

### Room Assignments

Options:
1. First deposit = first pick
2. Random draw
3. Groom picks, then lottery
4. Best man gets his own room for organizing (optional)

Couch spots get a discount ($25-50 off).

### The Morning Issue

Some guys wake up at 7am. Some are dead until noon. Set quiet hours (midnight to 9am in bedrooms) and let people do their thing.

---

## Step 7: What Goes Wrong

### "I Can't Make It Anymore"

Deposits are non-refundable. If someone drops:
- Group splits their share
- Exception for true emergencies

### Someone Can't Afford It

- Offer a payment plan
- Give them a cheaper room option
- Let them skip one activity
- Don't make it weird

### Group Can't Decide

Organizer makes the call. That's why you're in charge.

### Someone Goes Too Hard

- Buddy system
- Everyone knows the address
- Know when to cut someone off
- Water and food help

### The Groom Gets Out of Hand

- It's his weekend, but keep him alive
- Make sure he gets home
- No permanent decisions (tattoos, etc.)
