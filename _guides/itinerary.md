You've got the crew. Now you need the plan. Here's the definitive playbook for a bachelor party in New Orleans—minute by minute, no guesswork required.

---

<h2 id="day-1">Day One: Arrive & Warm Up</h2>

### 12:00 PM - Touch Down

Fly into MSY (Louis Armstrong International). It's 20-30 minutes from the French Quarter. Grab an Uber XL or split a couple cars.

**Pro tip:** Have someone arrive early to stock the fridge with beer, mixers, and breakfast basics. You'll thank yourself later.

### 2:00 PM - Check In

Most vacation rentals have 3-4pm check-in. Arrive, claim beds (first come, first served or draw straws), and crack the first beers.

### 3:00 PM - Pool Time or Golf

**Option A: Pool**
Private pool at the house. Music on, beers cold, no agenda. This is the warm-up.

**Option B: Golf**
If your crew golfs, hit the links first. Options:
- **TPC Louisiana** - Championship course, 45 min from city
- **City Park Golf Course** - Solid municipal course, 15 min out
- **Audubon Golf Course** - Shorter course, right in Uptown

Book tee times in advance. Afternoons are hot in summer.

### 7:00 PM - Clean Up

Shower, change, shake off the travel. Give guys an hour to get ready.

### 8:00 PM - Dinner at Cochon

Southern food done right. This is Louisiana cuisine at its finest—boucherie platters, fried alligator, and serious cocktails.

**Reserve 2-3 weeks ahead for groups of 10+.**

### 10:00 PM - Night One: Easy Does It

Start easy. Walk around the French Quarter, grab a drink at Pat O'Brien's, maybe hit Frenchmen Street for some jazz. Don't go too hard—you've got two more days.

**Recommended:** End by midnight. Trust me.

<h2 id="day-2">Day Two: The Main Event</h2>

### 9:00 AM - Morning Activity

Pick one based on your crew:

**Fishing Charter**
Book a redfish charter out of Venice or Lafitte. You'll catch fish, drink beer, and have stories for years. Half-day trips run 4-5 hours.

- **Cajun Fishing Adventures** - Solid reputation
- **Louisiana Fishing Charters** - Good for beginners
- Cost: ~$150-200/person for half-day

**Golf Round Two**
If you golfed Day 1, hit a different course. Or do 36 if your crew is serious.

**Swamp Tour**
Don't knock it. You'll see gators, drink beer on a boat, and learn about Cajun culture. Actually memorable.

### 2:00 PM - Return & Recovery

Back to the house. Pool time, food, naps. This is important—you need to recover before the big night.

Order food in or grill something. Don't waste energy going out for lunch.

### 5:00 PM - Pre-Game

Showers, getting ready, music loud. This is when the night starts.

### 7:00 PM - Dinner

**Option A: Steakhouse**
- **Doris Metropolitan** - Best steak in the city
- **Ruth's Chris** - The original (started in NOLA)
- **Dickie Brennan's** - Local favorite

**Option B: Keep It Casual**
- **Cochon Butcher** - Same quality as Cochon, more casual
- **Peche** - Seafood, James Beard winner
- **The Joint** - Best BBQ in New Orleans

### 9:30 PM - Bourbon Street (Get It Over With)

You have to walk through it. Get a Hand Grenade, take some photos, absorb the chaos. Give it 45 minutes, then move on.

### 10:30 PM - Frenchmen Street

This is where the real night happens. Live jazz and brass bands in every bar, way better crowd than Bourbon. Start at The Spotted Cat, then bounce around.

**The rotation:**
1. **The Spotted Cat** - Incredible jazz, standing room only
2. **d.b.a.** - Great music, more space
3. **The Maison** - Three floors, multiple bands
4. **30/90** - Good for late night

### 2:00 AM - Late Night Eats

You'll be hungry. Options:
- **Verti Marte** - The "All That Jazz" po'boy is legendary
- **Dat Dog** - Gourmet hot dogs, open late
- **Clover Grill** - 24-hour diner, exactly what you need

### 3:00 AM+ - Your Call

Bars don't close. The casino is open. Make good decisions (or don't).

<h2 id="day-3">Day Three: Recovery & Departure</h2>

### 10:00 AM - Slow Start

Sleep in. No alarms. Coffee when you wake up.

### 11:00 AM - Beignets at Cafe Du Monde

It's cliché because it's perfect. Get there, order beignets and coffee, get powdered sugar everywhere. This is the move.

### 12:30 PM - Final Stroll

Walk through Jackson Square, hit a bar for one last drink, buy some souvenirs if that's your thing.

### 2:00 PM - Check Out

Pack up, clean the house, head to the airport. You did it.

## Budget Breakdown

Here's what to expect per person for a 3-day weekend:

| Item | Estimated Cost |
|------|----------------|
| Accommodations (split) | $150-250 |
| Food (all meals) | $200-300 |
| Drinks & nightlife | $150-250 |
| Activities (golf/fishing) | $100-200 |
| Ubers | $30-50 |
| **Total** | **$630-1,050** |

This varies based on how many guys, where you stay, and how hard you go.

## Collecting Money

The hardest part of bachelor parties: getting guys to pay.

1. **Set a budget early** - Get buy-in on the number before you book
2. **Collect deposits upfront** - 50% when you book accommodations
3. **Use Venmo/Splitwise** - One person pays, everyone settles up
4. **Round up** - Budget for some guys to flake. It happens.

## The Groom Question

Does the groom pay? Traditionally, no—his portion is split among the crew. But every group is different. Discuss early and get alignment.
