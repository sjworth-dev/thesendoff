      <h2>Planning</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>When is the best time to visit New Orleans?</h3>
        <p>March-May and October-November. Weather is comfortable, city is active. Summer is hot and humid. Mardi Gras (February/March) is incredible but expensive and crowded.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How far in advance should we book?</h3>
        <p>3-6 months for accommodations that fit large groups. 2-3 weeks for golf tee times and fishing charters. Earlier for popular weekends and events.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How many days do we need?</h3>
        <p>3 days / 2 nights is the sweet spot. Friday-Sunday. You can do 4 days if your crew has the time, but 3 is enough to do it right without exhaustion.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Who typically plans the bachelor party?</h3>
        <p>Best man usually takes the lead. But honestly, whoever is most organized should run point. Set up a group chat, collect money, make decisions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Money</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's a realistic budget per person?</h3>
        <p>$600-1,000 for a 3-day weekend, depending on activities and how hard you go. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accommodations (split): $150-250</li>
          <li>Food: $200-300</li>
          <li>Drinks/nightlife: $150-250</li>
          <li>Activities: $100-200</li>
          <li>Ubers: $30-50</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does the groom pay?</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, no. His portion is split among the group. But every crew is different—discuss expectations early.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do we collect money from everyone?</h3>
        <p>Venmo or Splitwise. One person books everything and sends payment requests. Collect deposits early (50% when you book accommodations). Expect some guys to be slow—build in buffer time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Should we set up a kitty?</h3>
        <p>Some groups collect a flat amount upfront for shared expenses (food, drinks at the house, Ubers). Makes it easier than nickel-and-diming everything. $100-200/person usually covers it.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Accommodations</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Hotel or vacation rental?</h3>
        <p>For groups of 10+, vacation rental every time. You stay together, have private space, and often pay less per person. Hotels work for smaller groups who want turndown service.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What neighborhoods should we stay in?</h3>
        <p>French Quarter or CBD for convenience to nightlife. Marigny/Bywater for something different. Garden District is nice but requires Ubers everywhere.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can we throw a party at the property?</h3>
        <p>Our recommended properties can handle groups. Private pools, outdoor space, no shared walls. Just be respectful of the property.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Activities</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the best activity for a bachelor party?</h3>
        <p>Depends on your crew. Golf is the most popular. Fishing is more memorable and unique. A swamp tour is surprisingly fun. Pick what your group actually enjoys.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How early do we need to book activities?</h3>
        <p>Golf: 1-2 weeks for regular courses, 3-4 weeks for TPC. Fishing charters: 2-3 weeks minimum. Swamp tours: 1 week usually fine.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can we really bring beer on a fishing charter?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Most charters expect it. Bring a cooler with beer and snacks. No glass bottles.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Nightlife</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is there really no last call?</h3>
        <p>Correct. Bars can stay open 24 hours. You can walk around with open containers. Pace yourself.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Bourbon Street or Frenchmen Street?</h3>
        <p>Walk through Bourbon Street once to see it. Spend your actual night on Frenchmen Street—better music, better crowd, better experience.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do we need to dress up?</h3>
        <p>Most bars are casual. If you're doing a nice steakhouse dinner, wear a collared shirt. Otherwise, shorts and a polo are fine almost everywhere.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Logistics</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do we need a car?</h3>
        <p>No. Uber/Lyft everywhere. Parking is expensive and you'll be drinking. The only exception is if you're doing multiple golf days at courses outside the city.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do we get from the airport?</h3>
        <p>Uber XL or split regular Ubers. It's 20-30 minutes to the French Quarter. Cost is about $25-35 per car.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Any safety concerns?</h3>
        <p>Use common sense. Stick together at night. Uber instead of walking late. Don't flash cash. Stay aware of your surroundings. You'll be fine.</p>
